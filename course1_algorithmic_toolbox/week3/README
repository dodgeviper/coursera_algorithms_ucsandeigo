This week is about Greedy Algorithms.

Main Ingrediants:
- Find Safe move
- Prove safety
- Solve the subproblem
- Estimate the runtimes

- Safe Moves:
All safe moves are greedy but not all greedy moves are safe.

Always look for maximum, minimum, leftmost, rightmost, first

Optimization:
- Always look if sorting reduces the complexity


Greedy Strategy:

Problem -> safe move -> subproblem -> Problem ->....

- Make a greedy choice
- Prove that it is a safe move
- Reduce the subproblem
- Solve the problem
